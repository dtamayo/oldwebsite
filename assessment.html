			<p>
            As I emphasized on the Course Design page, I think it is crucial to a successful course to align the assessments with the course goals.  These goals 
            should be clearly enunciated to students up front, and their connection to the assignments and exams transparent.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I think frequent feedback for students through assessments is important.  I also find that a mixture of low and high-stakes assessments are useful:
			At the lowest-stakes end is frequent student journaling that is simply graded for completion.  Through it students have more latitude to explore their 
			thoughts, frame questions, and consolidate knowledge.  I was skeptical of these kinds of techniques at first, but I truly benefitted from my exposure 
			to it in the course I took "Practice of Teaching in Higher Education."  It adds an element to the course that is more self-directed by shifting some 
			responsibility on what is learned onto the student and purposefully sets aside time to integrating course material.  Through well-crafted prompts it 
			can also allow students to become more aware of their optimal learning styles, strengths and weaknesses.
			</p>
			<p>
			Homeworks provide a medium-stakes avenue that is more structured.  I think it is crucial to develop purposeful problem sets.  Students spend much 
			longer working on homework sets than they do in class.  As a result, homeworks can potentially be the area in which students learn most.  I therefore 
			consider it important to carefully select, adapt, and sequence problems.  Furthermore, they should always be a work in progress!  When I'm in a position 
			where I would teach a course several times I would want to keep a homework journal.  Each year, I would take away the problems that didn't work, improve 
			the ones that did, and seek out new ones.
			</p>
			<p>
			Exams provide high-stakes settings for feedback.  They should be modeled after the homeworks.  I don't mean that questions should be repeated, only 
			that they should never require skills that were not developed in the homeworks.  I strive for my courses to be fluid and transparent from the beginning.
			</p>
			Finally, I believe that even in physics and astronomy classes, paper assignments can be powerful.  This is particularly true for non-major astronomy 
			classes and upper level elective majors courses where the content does not necessarily provide a stepping stone for further courses in the curriculum.  
			In the latter case, a term paper allow students to explore a topic they find particularly motivating, dip their feet into the literature (and learn 
			basic skills in searching it), and gain some practice in quasi-academic writing (and learning packages like LaTeX).  At the other end of the spectrum,
			 in a non-majors astronomy course (see my Course Design page), a paper provides a more effective medium through which to reflect on and wrestle with 
			 the scientific method, its merits and potential pitfalls.
			</p>
			<p>
			I find that many young undergraduates do not have strong writing skills, often because they have never been explicitly taught it.  I therefore think 
			it is extremely valuable to require a first draft for which they receive feedback and improve it into a final draft.  I will in fact spend much longer 
			going through first drafts and providing comments than on the final draft.  The first draft represents the learning opportunity and a chance for 
			improvement.  The final draft is simply a grade that will soon be forgotten.  I also incorporate peer feedback as a way to incorporate more comments 
			and for students reading other papers to see their own papers through a new lens.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The trouble I have seen with some paper assignments is that they're haphazardly thrown into the course.  The expectations are vague, and the assessment 
			is, of course, more subjective than an exam.  I therefore find grading rubrics to be a useful tool.  Not only do they make the grading easier and more 
			objective, they provide a framework for students to assess and improve their own writing.  I provide a sample rubric for a generic paper in a science 
			course below.  I have tried to clearly demarcate important categories, and to meaningfully differentiate between levels.  I also incorporate an 
			innovative idea I obtained from McKeachie's Teaching Tips book of asking students to provide a cover page for their paper.  In it students reflect on 
			what they gained from writing the paper, and identify what they perceive as its strengths and weaknesses.  Not only is this valuable for the student, 
			it allows for more meaningful comments from the reader since he/she can react to the difficulties of the writer.
