			<p>
            As I alluded to on my <a href="teaching.html">Teaching</a> page, I have a top-down approach to course design.  I start by carefully considering the 
            learning outcomes I want for the students in my course.  I then structure the class with assessments that directly test those outcomes, and finally 
            choose and design course content that will allow students to succeed.  Of course this is over-simplified; in reality the process is more iterative than 
            I claim, but in my final syllabus revisions I always test this uni-directional coherence:  do my assessments test my course learning outcomes?  Does 
            my course content align with the learning outcomes?  I think such coherence and transparency is crucial to the value of a course.  In my experience as 
            both a student and TA, the most frustrating courses for students are those where homeworks and exams are disconnected, or where lectures leave one 
            completely unprepared to tackle the homework.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have prepared a <a href="files/syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> for a non-major Solar System course.  I have not had the opportunity to teach it yet, but I chose 
			to put one together as both a course I would love to teach and a likely candidate for what I might teach in my academic career.  
			</p>
			<p>
			My overarching goals for a non-major astronomy course are not content-specific.  Whether there is a liquid water ocean beneath Europa's ice crust is 
			of no practical value to these students.  On the other hand, developing students' ability to apply the scientific method (controlling biases, avoiding 
			groupthink through falsifiable predictions, etc.) can be extremely useful across a wide variety of careers and in students' own lives.  Critical, 
			scientific thinking is therefore the heart of my course.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The content is then a vehicle for modeling scientific thought and progress.  The beauty of an astronomy course is that the content is set on the 
			grandest possible stage.  You deal with distances so colossal, speeds so stupefying, and explosions so cataclysmic that students are going to be 
			gripped.  They will want to know whether there's water and life in Europa.  I pick content that will connect with students, and use it to model 
			the scientific process.  
			</p>
			<p>
			If scientific, critical thinking is the heart of my course, my assessments should reflect this.  I have multiple choice exams, but the focus would 
			be on students' ability to think through problems critically.  Rather than asking recall questions like "Which planet has the highest obliquity?", 
			I might ask "What effects would you expect for the Earth's climate if it had a higher obliquity?".  The homeworks are then designed to build these 
			critical thinking skills required for the exams.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I also allot the largest fraction of students' overall grade to a term paper where they wrestle with the question of 'How much can we trust science, 
			and how might we gauge the reliability of different scientific claims?.'  In a world full of science headlines with often opposing views on topics 
			like global warming and evolution, I think it is imperative for a future informed citizen to have reflected on these questions.  I include student 
			journaling outside of class as a medium for students to reflect on course content and on issues they might wish to incorporate into their term papers.
			</p>

			The course syllabus can be found here:  <a href="files/syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a>.  I'd welcome any feedback you might have!
