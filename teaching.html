            <p>
            I have a top-down approach to teaching.  In planning a course, I spend a substantial fraction of my time considering what skills and knowledge I want 
            students to leave my course with.  This will of course differ between classes--most notably between classes for majors and non-majors.  However, 
            in both cases, I am more interested in the process than the specific content.  For example, in a majors class the crux is not in the specifics of 
            how a derivation is performed; it lies rather in the concepts it incorporates and the techniques and thought process involved in tackling it.  
            I want to develop the next generation of astronomers and physicists that can solve new unsolved problems.  In a non-majors class I want students 
            to leave with the realization that critical and scientific thinking is also powerful in their personal and professional lives, independent of their 
            career choice.  Knowing where I want to end up allows me to purposefully craft lesson plans and assignments to get there.  I expand on this and provide 
            a sample syllabus for a non-major Solar System course in the <a href="courseDesign.html">Course Design</a> section.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I believe that nothing will impact what students learn in a course more than the instructor's choice of assignments and assessments.  Students are 
			conditioned to fixate on grades, and will allot their time based on the grade breakdown a teacher sets.  I therefore try to match my assessment choices 
			as closely as possible with my course goals.  More details, and a sample grading rubric for a term paper in the Solar System course I developed can be 
			found in the <a href="assessment.html">Assessment</a> section.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once my course goals are firm and I structure my course with assessments geared to meeting those ends, I can focus on the classes themselves.  
			My guiding principle is to have students actively engaged.  This does not mean every class having a demonstration involving all the students 
			running through the room.  In my experience as a student, lecturing can be both stimulating and engaging; it just must not be a one-way street.  
			Critical junctures require pauses, questions like "how would you go about solving this problem?", and follow-up discussion.  I use 'Think-Pair-Share' 
			questions to work through difficult concepts and also to get feedback on the understanding of material already presented.  I don't ever want students 
			to just a be listening--I want them to continually be thinking through the material, questioning it, and integrating it with their prior knowledge 
			into a cohesive web.  I consider a class with few questions not as evidence of clarity in my explanations, but rather as the result of my failure 
			to engage students in their own critical thinking.  I also find in-class demonstrations and multimedia to be powerful ways of presenting difficult 
			concepts in more than one way, as well as of breaking up class-time and refocusing attention.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have tried to incorporate the above pieces into a unified <a href="files/TeachingPhilosophy.pdf">Teaching Philosophy</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			I try to continually evolve as a teacher, discarding what doesn't work, improving what does, and being open to new ideas.  Of course I manage this better
			 at some times than others, but I like to think that the trend is always upward.  I find the last area, that of being open to new ideas, to be the most 
			 challenging.  It is easy to develop a teaching style that works well and to simply stay in that comfort zone.  I therefore make an effort to take 
			 courses and attend workshops that force me outside of my comfort zone.  Some teaching techniques I have learned simply did not work for me; but some, 
			 like student journaling, I found surprisingly effective once I gave them a chance.  You can find teaching courses and and workshops I have completed, as
			  well as my teaching experience to date, in my <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
