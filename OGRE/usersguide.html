			So far, OGRE can only read SWIFT files (and a proprietary code by Doug Hamilton called dI that I use).  It can't yet read a bin.dat file directly,
			so you have to use the gen_swift script at the bottom of the <a href="download.html">Download</a> page.  This will generate a text file of
			the output using SWIFT's built-in tools.  Let me know what other formats you'd like to see!
			<br>
			<br>
			Assuming you now have a run.swift file (generated with gen_swift--here's an example file:  <a href="mearth.swift.zip" target="_blank">mearth.swift.zip</a>),
			go to File -> Open Simulation.  In the dialog, select SWIFT under file type.  Right now there is a bug when it tries to read in XYZ coordinates that
			will hopefully be resolved soon, so you need to have the output in orbital elements (the default for SWIFT).  Then hit browse, and select your file.
			If your simulation spans a large number of orbits, you can check the 'Draw full orbit' box to display the osculating orbit rather than the 
			instantaneous position of the particle.
			<br>
			<br>
			The remove options in the file menu, as well as those in the options menu, are self-explanatory.  The equatorial and ecliptic data file options 
			in the file menu are there for some applications I had related to moons lying in different orbital planes.  They're used
			to display a set of orbits that aren't changing in time, for reference.  Ecliptic corresponds to the xy plane that's initially displayed, while
			equatorial depends on the obliquity of the planet.  I plan to soon generalize this so that you can enter fixed orbits with their elements referenced
			to an arbitrarily oriented plane, but that's not in yet.  The format for the static orbits is a .csv file (you can save files in this format using
			Google documents or Excel), where the columns in sequence represent:  The object name (not used), the semimajor axis (in whatever units you're using
			for the whole simulation--it gets scaled), the eccentricity, the inclination (all angles in degrees, and the reference plane is by default the xy 
			plane of the simulation), the longitude of the ascending node, the argument of pericenter, the frame at which you want the orbit to first be displayed,
			the last frame in which you want the orbit to be displayed, and the last three columns are to set the color of the orbit, with values of R(ed), G(reen)
			 and B(lue).  Despite the color choices and resolution, a nice example of using start and end times for displaying orbits is the first movie on 
			 the <a href="../OGRE.html">OGRE</a> page.  Here is the associated spreadsheet for the outer satellites (in green) that are displayed in succession:
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="SatEclMoons.csv.zip" target="_blank">SatEclMoons.csv.zip</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once the simulation loads, you can rotate with the mouse (rotations around the more intuitive two axes are done while holding the left mouse button,
			but you can also rotate around the third axis by holding the right button), you can zoom in our out, and change the time using the sliders on 
			the right, jump to a particular frame (timestep in the simulation), or check the play button for it to play automatically (you can set the time
			step for playing above it, e.g., a time step of 7 will only display every seventh frame).  
			<br>
			<br>
			The transformation settings are displayed on the top left of the simulation window.  These are there to help you choreograph transformations in 
			the Action Queue, but won't show up in your final movie.  To choreograph a movie, you can stage different actions using the 'Action Type' dropdown
			menu on the bottom right, and entering parameters for the rotations/zooms/pauses etc. you want to perform at particular points in the movie, and 
			how long you want the transformation to be spread out over (the 'Span' value in seconds).  These will be recorded in the Action Queue.  You can
			hit the 'Playback' button on the bottom right to view what your movie will look like, and when you're ready to record your movie, just hit the 
			'Record button' on the bottom right.  This will create a .mp4 file wherever you choose to put it (it will bring up a dialog).  A nice example of such 
			sequences is the first movie on the <a href="../OGRE.html">OGRE</a> page, which only uses static orbits to show the Saturn system to 
			scale and highlight the irregular satellite population.
